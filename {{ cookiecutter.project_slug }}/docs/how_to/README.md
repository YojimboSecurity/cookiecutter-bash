# How To

How-to guides solve real-world problems and a series of steps or directions to
achieve a specific task. A how-to guide answers a question that a user with some
experience could accomplish. The difference between a tutorial and a how-to is
the intended audience. The tutorial audience is that of a complete beginner. The
audience for a how-to guide is experienced users. Less detail is needed and more
assumed knowledge acceptable in a how-to.
